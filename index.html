            <h1>Nat Welch:<br />CHANGELOG.TXT</h1>
            <p>Starting in 2011, I decided to create a changelog for my life. For those of you in the software world, this may make total sense, but for the rest of you, I'll explain. Basically, a changelog is a list of all changes a project has undergone since the last "release". So for every "release", I plan on including a current picture, a list of significant events since the last release, and anything else of note. I'm still trying to figure out how I want to write the changes, so these will probably change over time. Also, I'm slowly going back to retroactively write old release notes.

            <br /><br />Hope you enjoy,<br />/Nat</p>
