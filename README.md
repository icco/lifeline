# Lifeline

I eventually want this hosted at [life.natwelch.com](http://life.natwelch.com).

The idea is to have pictures and single sentences to show how I have grown over my life. I don't plan anything as epic as the [Feltron Reports][fr] but I do want to be able to remember important parts of my life. The key here is to be able to track how I have grown over the years. 

Things I plan on listing:

 * Birthdays.
 * pet life spans (at least Snuggles, Sam and Spinner).
 * Family births / deaths.
 * school enrollment
 * employment
 * awards
 * trips (boy scouts, international travelling, etc.)
 * Other important events

## Design

I want to keep this relatively abstract, but the goal is to organize my data, not create something other people can use. I plan on having all of the data stored in JSON and in a single image folder.
