# Lifeline

This originally started as a project to make a JSON timeline of my life. I basically wanted to scroll through my life. After talking with @dmpatierno though, I have decided that having a life changelog would be far more interesting. For now I'm going to store the data in JSON, but in reality, having it as Markdown or some other simple markup format would make more sense.

I eventually want this hosted at [life.natwelch.com](http://life.natwelch.com).
